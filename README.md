# Atom theme
This is the customized theme I use in Atom.
It uses the One Dark theme as a base with some simple style customizations in the [styles.less](styles.less) file.

You can download the theme directly in Atom or download the [One dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui) and [One Dark Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) themes individually.
